    <h1 id="top-page">Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
        <h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>
        <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>
        <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lorises here.</p>
        <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
        <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>
        <h2 class="emphasized">Some people italicize and bold too much.</h2>
        <p>I <em>really</em> feel that <span class="emphasized">some</span> writers use <i>way</i> too much bold and an <strong>incredible amount</strong> of italics when they <span class="standout">could</span> use <b>far fewer</b> of these text effects.</p>
        <p class="spacey">It's great to be able to control spacing between letters, words and lines, but, unless you're a professional designer, it's a good idea not to try to be too creative with these options.</p>
        <h3>Centered headings can look very nice.</h3>
        <p class="pretty">Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>
        <p class="tabbed">Whether you indent the first line of a paragraph or not, and how much you indent, is a matter of taste. Some designers prefer to separate paragraphs with whitespace, specifying bottom margins. Other designers like to indent the first line. Usually, when one method is used, the other method is not used.</p>
        <blockquote><p>By default, a blockquote is set in. Optionally, you can also style it, as I do here by specifying grey in the CSS. Frequently, designers also change the size of blockquote text, making it either smaller or larger than normal text. And, of course, you can change the font-family if you want to. But avoid fancy fonts, please.</p></blockquote>
        <p class="offset">This paragraph has extra whitespace all around it. Offsetting text this way signals to the reader that the content is outside the flow of the main body of text.</p>
        <h3 class="siding">This is to demonstrate borders!</h3>
        <h4> This should be centered!</h4>
        <p class="double">This should be center as well.<br> The reason it should be is because of the grouping.</p>
        <h2 id="flash"> This should be in orange text, and is my first ID.</h2>
        <div id="superman">
          <h2>This is the first Division that I have coded. </h2>
          <p>In this division is a paragraph about how superman is from Krypton. He is the man of steel, and often works along side the dark knight.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This is my wrap around paragraph. It should be long enough to wrap around the picture of the Loris. It should also create a small margin between the paragram and the image.</p>
        <p class="no-wrap">This paragraph should hopefully clear the wrap. Which means get below the image and not to the right side of it. I am still struggling to type enough content to make an actual paragraph, and I still think a loris looks like a small sloth with really big eyes.</p>

        <p>This paragraph is going to display the linking that we learned in chapter 30. There are many confusing things touched on in this chapter, And I know more reinforment will be needed, and more practice can be found at this <a href="http://asmarterwaytolearn.com/why-exercises.html">link.</a> In the future remember to put the "Anchor" at the end of the web address, or nothing will show up on the site.</p>
        <a href="#top-page">TO THE TOP</a>
        <p>This paragraph will have a link in it that should open up a new window and take you <a href="http://asmarterwaytolearn.com"target="_blank">here</a></p>
